# Integrated Geo-Referenced Fish Catch Data Repository and Access System

This project is an **Integrated Geo-Referenced Fish Catch Data Repository and Access System** built using Python (Flask), MySQL, and frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system is designed to store, manage, and analyze fish catch data, allowing users to log their catches along with geographical data (latitude and longitude) and predict future fish catches based on historical data.

## Features

- **Fish Catch Data Entry:** Users can log details about fish catches, including fish type, quantity, catch date, and geographic location (latitude, longitude).
- **Geo-Referencing:** Each catch is linked to geographic coordinates, allowing users to visualize data on a map.
- **Fish Catch Prediction:** The system uses historical data to predict future fish catches based on date and location.
- **Role-Based Access:** Admins can manage users and access analytics, while fishermen can log catches and view predictions.
- **Data Analytics:** Generates insights and trends based on fish catch data.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Maps Integration for Geo-Referencing
- **Backend:**
  - Python (Flask)
  - MySQL Database
  - SQLAlchemy for ORM (if used)
- **Additional Features:**
  - Role-based user authentication
  - Data security and privacy
  - Prediction model (basic or AI-based)
